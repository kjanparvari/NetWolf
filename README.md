# Net Wolf - P2P File Distribution Software  

This project implements a **peer-to-peer (P2P) file distribution software** from scratch using only Python's **socket library**. The software allows users to form a cluster, send file requests, and distribute files among peers. The cluster is managed automatically through periodic **Discovery Messages**.  

## Features  
- **Cluster Formation**: Users form a dynamic P2P cluster for file sharing.  
- **File Requests**: Peers can send requests to receive files from other nodes.  
- **Automated Cluster Management**: Periodic **Discovery Messages** ensure efficient and seamless cluster operations.  
- **Socket Programming**: Built entirely with Python's low-level socket library for networking.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Networking**: Socket Programming  

## Purpose  
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of peer-to-peer networking and distributed systems, focusing on file sharing and cluster management.
